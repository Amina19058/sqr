[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/sqr-inno/s23/s23-lab-1-introduction-to-the-quality-gates/badges/main/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/sqr-inno/s23/s23-lab-1-introduction-to-the-quality-gates/-/commits/main)

## Homework

As a homework you will need to add autodeploy to your project. I would recommend to use something like [AWS](https://console.aws.amazon.com), [Heroku](https://heroku.com) or [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) (Digital Ocean and some other providers are free if you have [GitHub](https://education.github.com/students) license for students).  To check if server is running open this link: `http://<your-server>:8080/hello/`

**Lab is counted as done, if you have your app is running on server, and pipelines are passing.**
